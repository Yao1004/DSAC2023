## Description
These are projects from Digital Sound and Art Creation in NTU, I took this course in Fall 2023.
This course is mainly about how to generate audio and video using digital approach.

## Midterm

We use the app called Puredata to generate the sounds, and use socket to make it play the melody.
We chose the song called Time Back with a little revision as our project.

### Approach

We made our own MIDI file (in Midterm/textfile) and our own voice (in Midterm), with a lot of adjustment.
Then use Midterm/comm.py to transform the MIDI file into signal, sent by socket at the exact time.
Finally, we created a beautifula voice.

### Usage

Install [Puredata](https://puredata.info/downloads), and open Midterm/final.pd, and execute comm.py.

## Final

Final Project contains graphic creation, and is displayed in a immersive theatre.
We use p5.js, Blender, Scratch to create different kind of graphics, and use Logic to write the song - He's a pirate and with some revision.
